      <h1 class="h_1">WHY M1C </h1>
      <h1 class="h_2 te_c">Why should you choose us as a partner for your business?</h1>
      <p> Our corporate philosophy is built on the premise that our service to our clients and customers
        
        should reflect our Empathy, outmost honesty, uprightness, and transparency in our dealings, we
        
        respect our customers’ needs and carefully plan our work of execution. We follow a business
        
        policy of placing ourselves in clients position to understand better their needs and perspective
        
        so that our services are delivered in time in a most desired way with quality and cost effective
        
        way from the customers point of view. We strive hard to be honest on our dealings with
        
        uprightness and in particular to be transparent. We believe that without transparency and
        
        honesty we cannot built a lasting relationship with customers/clients so essential for achieving
        
        higher orbit of growth.<br>
        <br>
        <b class="bold-font">Novell VIBE:</b> we use vibe as a shared platform and as a client you are allowed to take
        full
        
        advantage of it. Once a client is registered with us, they get a unique id and password which
        
        they can use to log in to the shared workspace. Here the clients are able to monitor the status
        
        of the project, besides that the client are able to comment on the project process. Meeting
        
        Agendas and Minutes of the Meeting (MOM) will be shared on the workspace so the client can
        
        easily find out what has been discussed at the latest meeting. Contract and paper-works will
        
        also be uploaded on the vibe workspace so the clients can easily access and refer back to the
        
        clauses of contract if failed to recall.<br>
        <br>
        Internal Time Registration tool like Time Sheet Reporter (TSR) will be used to supervise the
        
        hours spent on the client’s project checks for possible time waste and opportunities for
        
        streamlining. On clients request a report can be prepared of the hours. We believe that being
        
        transparent in this area will allow the client to understand the cost involved in completing a
        
        particular project. <br>
