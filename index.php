    <p>
      The Current outlook of shipping companies operating within tighter margins, looking for ways to

      scale up their savings, and so Marine IT services has started to gain momentum. Rising demand

      for Marine IT services combined with the aim to aid shipping companies to focus on their core

      competency led the Martime1stChoice founders to establish the company.<br><br>
      Maritime1stChoice belongs to the Reesen Group, and had a humble beginning in the autumn

      2013 in Denmark as its Headquarter. With a need and desire to provide Quality service at faster

      pace blended with competitive pricing, the Founder, CEO – Mr. Leif R. Brodthagen reached out

      to Tamil Nadu, India in 2015. Soon Maritime1stChoice IT Consultancy India LLP was founded

      together with Mr. Nithya Kumar, the Founding Partner and Manager/CEO of the Indian Office

      and Mr. Sankaran Krishnan, the HR Consultant.

      <h1 class="h_1">WHY M1C </h1>
      <h1 class="h_2 te_c">Why should you choose us as a partner for your business?</h1>
      <p>Our corporate philosophy is built on the premise that our service to our clients should reflect our

        Empathy, Utmost Honesty, Uprightness, and Transparency in our dealings. We respect our

        Clients need and carefully plan our work execution accordingly. We follow a business policy of

        placing ourselves in the clients position to better understand their needs and perspective, so

        that our services fits their need and are delivered on time in the most desired cost effective way

        with a high level of quality. We strive hard to be honest with our dealings with uprightness and

        in particular to be transparent. We believe that without transparency and honesty we cannot

        build a lasting relationship with clients which is so essential for achieving higher orbit of growth.<br>
        <br>
        As a shared platform, we use Novell Vibe as a shared platform and as a client you are allowed to

        take full advantage of this. Once a client is registered with us, they get a unique id and password

        which they can use to log in to the shared and personal workspace. Here the clients are able to

        monitor the status of the project, besides that the clients are also able to comment on the

        project process. Meeting Agendas and Minutes of the Meeting (MOM) will be shared on the

        workspace so the clients can easily find out what has been discussed at the latest meeting.

        Contracts and other documents will also be uploaded on the vibe workspace so the clients can

        easily access and refer back to the clauses of contract if failed to recall.<br>
        <br>
        Internal Time Registration tool like Time Sheet Reporter (TSR) will be used to supervise the hours

        spent on the client’s projects for possible time waste and opportunities for streamlining. On

        clients request a report can be prepared on the hours spent for a particular project. We believe

        that being transparent in this area will allow the client to understand the cost involved in

        completing the project. <br>
